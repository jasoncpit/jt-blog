For most of my life, I’ve struggled with perfectionism. I don’t mean the kind that pushes you to do your best — I mean the kind that whispers:  

- *“Don’t share this yet. It’s not polished enough.”*  
- *“People will think it’s naive.”*  
- *“If you don’t finish it, you’re a failure.”*  

That voice has kept me from finishing more projects than I can count. I’ll get excited about an idea, spend hours sketching it out, and then freeze when it comes time to show it to the world. The shame of an “unfinished” project becomes heavier than the joy of creating it in the first place, which unfortunately is what I often feel when I'm not actively working on a project. 

### Reframing the cycle  

Creating and sharing ideas is a key part of my creative process, and I want to be able to do it more often. A personal blog is a great way to do that - whether it's a place to share my ideas, or a place to document my journey of creating them - most importantly, to share my viewpoint on the world.

Recently, I came across [Oasis of Ideas](https://www.oasis-of-ideas.com/), a site where people share raw concepts in a structured, low-pressure way. It hit me: **what if I gave myself permission to share ideas at every stage, not just at the mythical finish line?**  

That thought led me here: to start an **idea garden** on my blog.  

Instead of demanding perfection, I’ll treat each idea like a seed. Some will sprout, some will bloom, some may go dormant — and that’s okay. What matters is that they exist in the open, visible and real, instead of buried in my notebooks or lost to shame.  

### What this will look like  

- **Seeds** 🌱: ideas I’ve just logged.  
- **Sprouts** 🌿: projects I’m actively exploring.  
- **Dormant** 🍂: things I’ve paused for now, but might come back to later.  
- **Blooms** 🌸: projects that reached a stage where I can share them more widely.  

Each entry will include a short summary, a progress tracker, and a little log of updates. More importantly, it’ll include reflections — why the idea excites me, what I’ve learned so far, and even why I might be stepping away.  

### Why I’m doing this  

This isn’t about building an audience or proving myself. I am hoping to break the perfectionist–shame cycle and build a healthier relationship with my creativity, and hopefully help others do the same.  

By showing up and documenting ideas as they are — messy, half-finished, evolving — I hope to remind myself that:  
- Creativity doesn’t need to be perfect to be valuable.  
- Effort is never wasted, even if the outcome looks different than I expected.  
- Sharing the journey matters just as much as sharing the destination.  

This idea garden will be my visible record: not of perfect projects, but of growth, experiments, and honest attempts.  

And maybe, in a small way, it will help me practice what I’ve always believed but struggled to embody:  
✨ *progress over perfection, visibility over shame.*
