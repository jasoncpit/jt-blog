Perfectionism has shaped a lot of how I’ve worked in the past. Too often, I’d hold back from sharing until something felt “finished” — which meant many ideas never left my notebook. The result: projects that could have sparked discussion or evolved into something bigger instead stayed hidden.

I’ve come to realise that sharing ideas earlier is just as important as finishing them. It allows for feedback, collaboration, and learning in public. This blog is my attempt to reframe how I approach creative work: not as a polished showcase, but as a living record of experiments, progress, and lessons learned. [1][2]

I want to treat ideas less like finished products and more like an idea garden — where some will sprout, some will bloom, and others may lie dormant until the right time. The value isn’t in perfection, but in visibility and growth.

## Designing the Idea Garden


How this will work

- Seeds 🌱: new ideas I’ve just logged.

- Sprouts 🌿: projects I’m actively exploring.

- Dormant 🍂: ideas on hold for now.

- Blooms 🌸: projects developed enough to share more widely.

Each entry will include a short description, progress notes, and reflections — what excites me, what I’ve learned so far, or why I’ve chosen to pause. The goal is to make this space part notebook, part sandbox, and part journal of experiments in data, AI, and maps.
