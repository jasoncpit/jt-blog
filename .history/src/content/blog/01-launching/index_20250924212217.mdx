Perfectionism has shaped a lot of how I’ve worked in the past. Too often, I’d hold back from sharing until something felt “finished” — which meant many ideas never left my notebook. The result: projects that could have sparked discussion or evolved into something bigger instead stayed hidden.

I’ve come to realise that sharing ideas earlier is just as important as finishing them. It allows for feedback, collaboration, and learning in public. This blog is my attempt to reframe how I approach creative work: not as a polished showcase, but as a living record of experiments, progress, and lessons learned.  

I want to treat ideas less like finished products and more like an idea garden — where some will sprout, some will bloom, and others may lie dormant until the right time. The value isn’t in perfection, but in visibility and growth.

Here's how I've envisioned the blog, the blog will be split into three sections:

- `blog`: blog posts are usually some kind of analysis or exploration of a topic, it could be a data analysis, a technical post, a tutorial, a review, etc.
- `projects`: projects posts are usually some kind of project that I've worked on, it could be a side project, a personal project, a client project, etc.
- `ideas`: ideas posts are usually some kind of idea that I've had, it could be a new product idea, a new business idea, a new technology idea, etc.
