## Background

I recently stumbled upon [Oasis of Ideas](https://www.oasis-of-ideas.com/), a platform that shares creative and practical ideas with the hope that others will pursue or browse through them for inspiration or support. I really like the ways they showcase the ideas, and the way they structure their content - summary, source of ideas, skills needed to execute, and some brief estimation of the time / resources needed. I think this is a not only a great way to share ideas with others, but also a great way to prioritize my own ideas. I want to try it out on my own blog, with a few tweaks of my own. It is called **Oasis of Ideas** here. 

## Oasis of Ideas example

## My tweaks

- I want to add a "summary" section to my ideas, where I can briefly describe the idea and why I think it's a good idea.
- I want to add a "source of ideas" section to my ideas, where I can link to the original source of the idea.
- I want to add a "skills needed to execute" section to my ideas, where I can list the skills needed to execute the idea.
- I want to add a "time / resources needed" section to my ideas, where I can estimate the time / resources needed to execute the idea.
