In this project, I investigate whether large language models (LLMs) can simulate realistic, persona-driven mobility patterns. The goal is not merely to generate plausible routes, but to emulate motivations, preferences, and temporal structure inherent in human movement. As part of the 2024 30-Day Map Challenge, I designed a multi-agent architecture inspired by recent advances (e.g. Wang et al. 2024) to let the model decide which points of interest (POIs) to visit, when, and why, depending on a persona’s life stage.

I define three life-stage personas (ages 25, 24, and 17) with distinctive daily habits, location constraints, and interests. For each persona, the system:

1. Generates weekly and daily itineraries using GPT-4o, by breaking the problem into a high-level planner (summary-level) and fine-grain daily planner (sequence-level).

2. Retrieves contextual POI candidates via Google Places API, and computes realistic commuting routes using Google Directions / Routes API to anchor the simulated trajectories in real geography.

3. Produces an interactive map (built with Deck.GL & React) where users can toggle between the daily plans of each persona and inspect decisions, timings, and inferred motivations.

In evaluation, I qualitatively compare output against my known patterns: for example, the 25-year-old persona tends toward West Kensington commuting and Stratford local activity, while the 17-year-old persona clusters around UCL and London’s music/arts scene. The AI’s behavior is impressively coherent in many cases (though with occasional oddities like impromptu café stops or playing badminton at exotic locations).

This work is exploratory and serves as a proof-of-concept: the generated trajectories are hypothetical, not actual personal records, ensuring privacy. The challenge lies less in perfect replication and more in pushing the boundary of how much “reasoning + personality” an LLM can encode in spatial and temporal mobility.
