As part of 2024 30 days Map Challenge, I explored how well AI can replicate my weekly mobility patterns across different life stages using LLM. The objective was to examine if AI could mimic my typical routes, identify my preferred destinations, and understand my underlying motivations, including subtle preferences based on the persona of the person. To test this out, I have created three personas based on my own life stages to see whether it make sense. 


Inspired by Wang et al. (2024), I constructed a multi-agent framework using LangGraph. This setup included a planner agent for high-level daily summaries and a detailed daily planner to generate temporally structured sequences of activities. Using Google Places and Routes API, I added contextually relevant POIs and realistic commute routes.

Here's how the AI interpreted each of my life stages:

1. 25-year-old: Married, based in Stratford, London, commuting three times a week to West Kensington. Weekdays often include work and badminton, while weekends feature culinary explorations, especially Asian cuisine, and occasional day trips with my wife.

2. 24-year-old: A postgraduate student living in North Finchley. Time is scarce, so I stick to university and nearby parks, favoring biking or walking over public transit.

3. 17-year-old: An avid music fan living near Warren Street, studying at university. Weekends are reserved for record hunting, local gigs, and library sessions—centered around London’s indie and jazz scene.

Using GPT-4o, I generated weekly and daily itineraries, producing seven-day mobility trajectories mapped using Deck.GL and React. The interactive map allows users to toggle between AI-generated daily plans across each life stage, offering an in-depth look at the AI-generated routines.

Findings: The AI’s output was impressively close to reality! For my 25-year-old self, the map accurately highlights Stratford hotspots and work-related patterns in West Kensington (and even a spontaneous Cambridge trip one weekend. Thanks, AI, for the adventure I didn’t know I needed). My 17-year-old self’s map concentrates around UCL and local social spots. However, there were some inconsistencies—like unexpected café visits during work breaks, which don’t align with my usual routines; and playing badminton at London Aquatics Center. This got me thinking—maybe in the future, I could incorporate POI choices using the agent to reflect routines better?

Disclaimer: The POIs and routes are simulated by AI to explore AI and mobility patterns, not actual reflections of my routine. Privacy is preserved in this approach.
