For today's entry, I explored how well AI can replicate my weekly mobility patterns across different life stages. 🚶‍♂️🚴‍♂️🚇 Using LangGraph and GPT-4o, the objective was to examine if AI could mimic my typical routes, identify my preferred destinations, and understand my underlying motivations, including subtle preferences—like my routine Tesco meal deal! 🥪

Inspired by Wang et al. (2024), I constructed a multi-agent framework using LangGraph. This setup included a planner agent for high-level daily summaries and a detailed daily planner to generate temporally structured sequences of activities. Using Google Places and Routes API, I added contextually relevant POIs and realistic commute routes.

Here's how the AI interpreted each of my life stages:

1️⃣ 25-year-old: Married, based in Stratford, London, commuting three times a week to West Kensington. Weekdays often include work and badminton, while weekends feature culinary explorations, especially Asian cuisine, and occasional day trips with my wife.

2️⃣ 24-year-old: A postgraduate student living in North Finchley. Time is scarce, so I stick to university and nearby parks, favoring biking or walking over public transit.

3️⃣ 17-year-old: An avid music fan living near Warren Street, studying at university. Weekends are reserved for record hunting, local gigs, and library sessions—centered around London’s indie and jazz scene.

Using GPT-4o, I generated weekly and daily itineraries, producing seven-day mobility trajectories mapped using Deck.GL and React. The interactive map allows users to toggle between AI-generated daily plans across each life stage, offering an in-depth look at the AI-generated routines.

Findings: The AI’s output was impressively close to reality! For my 25-year-old self, the map accurately highlights Stratford hotspots and work-related patterns in West Kensington (and even a spontaneous Cambridge trip one weekend. Thanks, AI, for the adventure I didn’t know I needed). My 17-year-old self’s map concentrates around UCL and local social spots. However, there were some inconsistencies—like unexpected café visits during work breaks, which don’t align with my usual routines; and playing badminton at London Aquatics Center. This got me thinking—maybe in the future, I could incorporate POI choices using the agent to reflect routines better?

Disclaimer: The POIs and routes are simulated by AI to explore AI and mobility patterns, not actual reflections of my routine. Privacy is preserved in this approach.
