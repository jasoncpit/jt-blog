During my PhD days, I wore two hats: researcher and teacher. On the research side, I wrangled GPUs and CUDA to speed up deep learning experiments, from address matching to disease models. On the teaching side, I got to share my love of stats, ML, and geocomputation with students, helping them make sense of the messy (but fascinating) world of data. Bonus: I also put out some open-source tools and guides to make sure the experiments didnâ€™t just work once, but reproducibly.
