Had some fun delivering analytical / machine learning solutions for 30+ retail and FMCG clients, including sales forecasting, location expansion strategies, and geospatial insights. Massive win: built a multi-agent system for geospatial querying with LangGraph, fine-tuned RoBERTa models for large-scale classification, and developed novel graph-based clustering algorithms that segments small-area geospatial clusters across Europe.
