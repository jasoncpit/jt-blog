Architected and productionized a fully automated ML-powered complaints platform on AWS, cutting case handling time by 35%. Designed end-to-end pipelines — from model training and deployment with SageMaker to serverless inference with Lambda — with CI/CD, safe rollouts, and CloudWatch observability. More interesting work to come!
