For my PhD, I spent a few years deep in the world of groceries — not stocking shelves, but modelling how people shop. I worked with Kantar WorldPanel to test the utility of consumer panel for understanding and simulating the British FMCG and “Food on the Go” markets. More specifically, I have worked with lots of choice modelling, generative models, gravity models, spatial microsiumation to understand choice behaviours under different regional and demographic settings. Think of it as taking the shopping receipt and turning it into a lens on society: a way to model retail geography, consumption behaviour, everyday decision-making, and the messy trade-offs between convenience, geography, price, and place.
