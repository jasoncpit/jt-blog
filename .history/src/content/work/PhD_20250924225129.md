For my PhD, I spent a few years deep in the world of groceries — not stocking shelves, but modelling how people shop. I worked with Kantar WorldPanel’s massive consumer panel to see how reliable everyday basket data is for understanding the British FMCG and “Food on the Go” markets. Along the way, I tested how representative the data really is, mined quirky patterns between products, regions, and demographics, and built models that predict why people choose one store over another.

The big takeaway? Consumer panels are far from perfect, but they’re powerful when you want to peek into shopping behaviour at scale. By combining panel data with geodemographics and retail gravity models, I could map out not just what households buy, but how mobility and choice play out across the country. Most importantly, I had lots of fun experimenting with generative and ML models to mimic how people shop and make everyday choices.

Think of it as taking the shopping receipt and turning it into a lens on society: a way to model retail geography, consumption behaviour, everyday decision-making, and the messy trade-offs between convenience, price, and place.
